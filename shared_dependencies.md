The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. "os" and "requests" Python libraries: These are used in smol_wizard.py for file handling and downloading files respectively.

2. "path" variable: This is an optional argument that sets the file location for downloaded and generated files. It is shared as it is used in the download and setup functions.

3. "download_files" function: This function is responsible for downloading the required files into the specified or default path folder.

4. "setup_files" function: This function is responsible for setting up the required files.

5. "prompt_user_action" function: This function prompts the user for action.

6. "prompt_user_for_api_keys" function: This function prompts the user for API keys.

7. "run_test_prompt" function: This function runs the test prompt once the action is complete.

8. "generate_clock" function: This function generates a clock in HTML/JS/CSS in a single self-contained .html file. It is part of the test prompt.

9. "api_keys" variable: This variable stores the API keys entered by the user.

10. "action" variable: This variable stores the user's action.

11. "test_prompt" variable: This variable stores the result of the test prompt.

12. DOM elements: The "clock" element in the generated HTML file is manipulated by the JavaScript code to display the current time.
